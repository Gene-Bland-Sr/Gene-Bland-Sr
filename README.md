Hi! I'm Gene Bland, Sr.  I'm an old (85), retired computer geek. When I started with them in 1959, they were all vacuum tubes and programed via a plug-board.  
I joined here to get a little help with LibreElec 11.0.3 on a RPI4.  I have programmed in COBOL, Fortran, Basic and Delphi.   
I am knowledgeable with Windows OS but, not so much with Linux.
